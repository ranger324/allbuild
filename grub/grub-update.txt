update grub2 and os-prober to make it "distribution friendly"
patches for (grub 2.02) and (os-prober 1.75)

(some linux disrto loads microcode by initrd line as a separate image file)
(grub-mount replaced with mount)

your distribution may contain distribution specific (modified) os-prober and
grub packages - or newer versions

--
patches:
- initrd patches - to handle (configuration generation) multiple files in initrd lines

grub-2.02-initrd.patch
os-prober-1.75-grub-initrd.patch

- ucode - look for microcode images (eg.: ucode.img)

grub-2.02-ucode-2.patch

- no grub-mount (grub-mount - read-only fuse based mount utility (makes searches in filesystems
  while it is mounted) - which is very slow)
  (this patch limits the mount capability to filesystems which are known by the linux kernel)

os-prober-1.75-no-grub-mount.patch

you may try to update these scripts by overwriting original files if these
packages are installed (create backup; copy files by overwriting original)

"files" directory contains:
- os-prober package's updated files and other files (scripts) without "newns" binary
  "/usr/lib/os-prober/newns"
- and updated grub files: "/etc/grub.d/10_linux" "/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober"

(you may set up grub to find other os-es on other partitions
	execute permission on file: /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
	#turn on
	chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
	#turn off
	chmod 644 /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober)
