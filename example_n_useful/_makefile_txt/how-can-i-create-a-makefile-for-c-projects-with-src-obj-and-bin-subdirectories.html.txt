       How can I create a Makefile for C projects with SRC, OBJ, and BIN
                                subdirectories?

   Ask Question

           A few months ago, I came up with the following generic Makefile for   
           school assignments:

           clean:                                                                
               @$(rm) $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS)                                       
               @echo "Cleanup complete!"                                         
                                                                                 
           This will basically compile every .c and .h file to generate .o files 
           and the executable projectname all in the same folder.                
                                                                                 
           Now, I'd like to push this a little. How can I write a Makefile to    
           compile a C project with the following directory structure?           
                                                                                 
            ./                                                                   
            ./Makefile                                                           
            ./src/*.c;*.h                                                        
            ./obj/*.o                                                            
            ./bin/<executable>                                                   
                                                                                 
           In other words, I'd like to have a Makefile that compiles C sources   
           from ./src/ into ./obj/ and then link everything to create the        
           executable in ./bin/.                                                 
                                                                                 
           I've tried to read different Makefiles, but I simply can't make them  
           work for the project structure above; instead, the project fails to   
           compile with all sorts of errors. Sure, I could use full blown IDE    
           (Monodevelop, Anjuta, etc.), but I honestly prefer to stick with      
           gEdit and the good ol' terminal.

                I just found a solution. If someone care to find something       
                better, the Makefile can still be improved. – Yanick Rochon Aug

              First, your $(OBJECTS) rule is problematic, because 1) it's     
              kind of indiscriminate, making all sources prerequisites of     
              every object, 2) it often uses the wrong source (as you         
              discovered with file1.o and file2.o) 3) it tries to build       
              executables instead of stopping at objects, and 4) the name of  
              the target (foo.o) is not what the rule will actually produce   
              (obj/foo.o). I suggest the following:                           
                                                                              
              OBJECTS  := $(SOURCES:$(SRCDIR)/%.c=$(OBJDIR)/%.o)              
                                                                              
              $(OBJECTS): $(OBJDIR)/%.o : $(SRCDIR)/%.c                       
                  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@                                 
                  @echo "Compiled "$<" successfully!"                         
                                                                              
              The $(TARGET) rule has the same problem that the target name    
              does not actually describe what the rule builds. For that       
              reason, if you type make several times, Make will rebuild the   
              target each time, even though there is no reason to. A small    
   up vote 19 change fixes that:                                              
   down vote                                                                  
   accepted   $(BINDIR)/$(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)                                 
                  $(LINKER) $@ $(LFLAGS) $(OBJECTS)                           
                  @echo "Linking complete!"                                   
                                                                              
              Once that's all in order, you might consider more sophisticated 
              dependency handling; if you modify one of the header files,     
              this makefile will not know which objects/executables must be   
              rebuilt. But that can wait for another day.                     
                                                                              
              EDIT:                                                           
              Sorry, I omitted part of the $(OBJECTS) rule above; I've        
              corrected it. (I wish I could use "strike" inside a code        
              sample.)

                   with your suggested changes, I get : obj/file1.o: In       
                   function 'main': \n main.c:(.text+0x0): multiple

                   @Yanick Rochon: Do you have multiple main functions? Maybe 
                   one in file1.c and one in main.c? If so then you will not  
                   be able to link these objects; there can be only one main  
                   in an executable. – Beta Aug 10 '11 at 5:49                
                   No, I do not. Everything works fine with the last version  
                   I posted in the question. When I change my Makefile to     
                   what you suggest (and I do understand the benefits of what 
                   you're saying) that's what I get. I just pasted file1.c    
                   but it gives the same message to every single files of the 
                   project. And main.c is the only one with a main            
                   function... and main.c imports file1.h and file2.h         
                   (there's no relation between file1.c and file2.c), but I   
                   doubt the problem comes from there. – Yanick Rochon Aug 10

                   @Yanick Rochon: I made a mistake pasting the first line of 
                   my $(OBJECTS) rule; I've edited it. With the bad line I    
                   got an error, but not the one you got... – Beta Aug 10 '11

     You can add the -I flag to the compiler flags (CFLAGS) to indicate where the     
     compiler should look for source files , and the -o flag to indicate where the    
     binary should be left:                                                           
                                                                                      
     CFLAGS   = -Wall -I./src                                                         
     TARGETPATH = ./bin                                                               
                                                                                      
     $(TARGET): obj                                                                   
         @$(LINKER) $(TARGETPATH)/$(TARGET) $(LFLAGS) $(OBJECTS)                      
         @echo "Linking complete!"                                                    
                                                                                      
     In order to drop the object files into the obj directory, use the -o option when 
     compiling. Also, look at the $@ and $< automatic variables.                      
                                                                                      
     For example, consider this simple Makefile                                       
up

     %.o: %.c                                                                         
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $(OBJDIR)/$@                                         
                                                                                      
     Update>                                                                          
                                                                                      
     By looking at your makefile, I realize you are using the -o flag. Good. Continue 
     using it, but add a target directory variable to indicate where the output file  
     should be written.

          could you be more specific? Do you mean adding -l ... to the CFLAGS and ... 
          there's already the -o argument to the linker (LINKER) – Yanick Rochon Aug

          Yes, the CFLAGS, and yes, keep using -o, just add the TARGETPATH variable.

             I have stopped writing makefiles these days, if your intention   
             is to learn go ahead, else you have good makefile generator that 
             comes with eclipse CDT. If you want some maintainability /

             the following -
